      "may have been the darling of the Wardline and the American Merchant Marine, but she was very far from being a happy ship. Ships are strange places.\n",

      "refreshed them. Nearly a full third of the passengers were members of the Concordia Singing Society, a German group out of New York. Dozens of couples\n",
      "with ties to the group boarded, including policeman Adolf Kostbother and his wife Mary, both down on D-deck opposite the Hagedorns, Minnie and Henry.\n",
      "Then there were all the newly married couples like Charles and Selma filter honeymooners from New York. Charles was a tall, handsome 20-something\n",

      "practised at finding their life jackets, putting them on and gathering at muster stations. But Wilmot thought excessive drills would panic passengers\n",
      "and put the thought of death at sea, the Titanic, the Lusitania, in their heads in the middle of their carefree voyage. Ever the people pleaser,\n",
      "Wilmot put his passengers' comfort above all else and rejected Smith's idea. It's safer on the ship, he said, than at Broadway and 42nd Street. Wilmot\n",
      "got his wish. The 318 passengers certainly enjoyed Wardline's floating Pleasure Palace. No doubt the newlyweds and the honeymooners mixed and chatted\n",

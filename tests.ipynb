      "period before the start of George Washington's presidency. Now since the American colonies were originally British, they initially had the same two\n",
      "political parties that Great Britain had, which were the Tories and the Whigs. Basically the Tories were those who strongly supported the monarchy\n",
      "whereas the Whigs were those who wanted to give local representatives more power. During the American Revolution, it was obviously the Whigs, also\n",
      "known as Patriots, who dominated, the loyalist Tories disappearing entirely in 1783, which is when the British finally recognized US independence.\n",
      "Thus, because the US had done away with monarchy altogether, they were left with just a single party, the Whigs. But this situation did not last for\n",
      "long. Although the US was now a republic, there were differences in opinion over how strong the new federal government should be. Those Those who\n",
      "wanted a strong federal government, with things like a central bank and a standing army, became known as Federalists, whereas those who wanted more\n",

      "reason why historians now call them Democratic Republicans is to distinguish them from the current Republicans who are not directly related. Okay, so\n",
      "from 1789 to 1824, the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans were the two main parties. Generally speaking, the Federalists appealed more to the\n",
      "upper classes who lived in cities and owned businesses whereas the Democratic Republicans appealed more to farmers and everyday folk. You'll notice\n",
      "that around the year 1800, the pink line and the green line switch places. That's because on this chart, the party that controlled the presidency is\n",
      "always shown on top. So basically, the Federalists were dominant during Washington's tenure and then officially held the presidency under John Adams,\n",

      "the name implies, was mostly focused on criticizing Freemasons who they saw as elites who wielded too much power. As well as the Nullification Party,\n",
      "which wanted to give states the right to nullify federal laws. Basically, some of the nullifiers, combined with the National Republicans as well as\n",

      "called the Barnburners to to form the Free Soil Party, shown in dark blue. The main goal of the Free Soil Party was to prevent the extension of\n",

      "nothing. But then in 1854, the issue of slavery came to a head with the passing of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which basically meant that slavery could\n",

      "is considered to have been the worst president in US history. But then four years later in 1860 came what would become the most consequential US\n",
